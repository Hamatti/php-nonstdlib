A PHP library to provide better API than standard library for managing things. #veryexperimental

I have a love-hate relationship with PHP. I've been building things on the web with it for almost 2 decades: from templating to full-blown MVC and SPA application backends.

What I have never done is a library for fellow developers (nor myself). And I want to build one. The biggest annoyance with PHP I have is the confusing standard library, so I decided to give a go at experimenting with building something on top of that.
